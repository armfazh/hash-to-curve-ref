/*
Package h2c provides implementations of hashing functions that take
arbitrary-length byte strings and output a point on an elliptic curve.

These methods follow the current work-in-progress standardization effort
at IETF https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve.

Version: draft-irtf-cfrg-hash-to-curve-05
